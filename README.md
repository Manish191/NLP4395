## Portfolio Assignment 1

First Portfolio Assignment

You can see the [document here](HW1.py)

Overview: The program takes a csv file, reads line by line and correctly formats the data, using regex and prompting the user for input as necessary. To run, simply provide the name of the csv file formated like Last,First,Middle Initial,ID,Office phone as a system argument.
Pythons inbuilt functions and boutiful libraries for string manipulation make text processing much simpler, and is my preference.
In this assignment I learned about pickling, and its strengths and weaknesses. Most of the I/O, regex, and data structures was primarily a review.
